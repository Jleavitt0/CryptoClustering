# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

In the challenge we will be accomplishing the follwing things

  1. Find the Best Value for k by Using the Original Data
  2. Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means by Using the Original Data
  3. Optimize the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
  4. Find the Best Value for k by Using the PCA Data
  5. Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means by Using the PCA Data
  6. Visualize and Compare the Results
